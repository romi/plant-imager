# Building the documentation

We use [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build the documentation with [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) theme.
The API documentation is generated by [`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/).
Also, we use [`markdown-exec`](https://pawamoy.github.io/markdown-exec) to execute some code snippets to generate output parsed in Markdown.
Finally, you may want to check the [`pymdown-extensions`](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions) documentation.

## Requirements
To install the requirements for documentation edition, simply run:
```shell
python -m pip install -e .[doc]
```

## Live edit
You can edit the documentation, `mkdocs.yaml` and the `docs` directory, and see the changes live by using:
```shell
mkdocs serve
```

You should see some logging and this message, indicating where to view it:
```
INFO    -  [14:39:21] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Publish online
The documentation is published online thanks to a CI job defined in the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` file.
